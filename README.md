# Concrete Crack Image Classification

This project uses machine learning to classify concrete images as either having cracks or not. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify concrete images as either having cracks or not. This is important because concrete cracks can be a sign of structural damage, and early identification of these cracks can help to prevent catastrophic failures.
