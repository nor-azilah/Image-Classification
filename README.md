# Concrete Crack Image Classification

This project uses machine learning to classify concrete images as either having cracks or not. 
The dataset used for this project can be found at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2.

Problem Formulation:

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify concrete images as either having cracks or not. This is important because concrete cracks can be a sign of structural damage, and early identification of these cracks can help to prevent catastrophic failures.

Data Preparation:

The dataset used for this project contains 40,000 images of concrete, split evenly between images with cracks and images without cracks. The images were pre-processed to ensure that they were all the same size and format.

Model Development:

A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to develop the model for this project. The CNN was trained on the pre-processed dataset, and it was able to achieve a training accuracy of 98% and a validation accuracy of 97%.

Model Deployment:

The model was deployed using a Flask API. This API allows users to upload images of concrete and receive predictions from the model.

Instructions:

To use this project, you will need to have the following installed:

Python 3
Pip

Credits

The dataset used for this project was provided by the Mendeley Data repository. The CNN model was developed using the Keras library.
